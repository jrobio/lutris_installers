  # Star Trek: Deep Space Nine - The Fallen

  This script installs **Star Trek: Deep Space Nine - The Fallen** through Wine.

  - Please report issues to the lutris_installer repo: 
  https://github.com/jrobio/lutris_installers

  ## Wine Install Notes

  - On first launch the game will also prompt you to select a display renderer.
  `D3D` is recommended as it is provided through `dgvoodoo2`.
  - Also on first launch, the game will generate the configuration file 
  `ds9.ini` located at `$GAMEDIR/Program Files (x86)/DS9TheFallen/system/`.
  - Settings specific to the renderer may not be exposed in a GUI menu. 
  Configuration options are available under `[D3DDrv.D3DRenderDevice]` in 
  `ds9.ini`.
