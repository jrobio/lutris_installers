## Wine Install Notes

`D3D` is recommended as it is provided through `dgvoodoo2`.
- Also on first launch, the game will generate the configuration file 
`ds9.ini` located at `$GAMEDIR/Program Files (x86)/DS9TheFallen/system/`.
- Settings specific to the renderer may not be exposed in a GUI menu. 
Configuration options are available under `[D3DDrv.D3DRenderDevice]` in 
`ds9.ini`.
