  # Star Trek: The Game Show

  This script installs **Star Trek: The Game Show** through Wine.

  - This installer expects a mounted disc containing the game.
  - Please report issues to the lutris_installer repo: 
  https://github.com/jrobio/lutris_installers

  ## Wine Install Notes

  - During Quicktime installation, you will be prompted to scan for existing 
  copies of quicktime. Select `Skip` and `Yes` to Cancel anyway. Otherwise, the 
  quicktime installer will attempt to look through all drives available in your 
  prefix, including your system mounted at `Z:`.
