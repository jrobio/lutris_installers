  # Star Trek: Starfleet Command II - Empires at War

  This script installs **Star Trek: Starfleet Command II - Empires at War**, the
  Sulu bonus missions, patches it to the latest official version (v2036), and 
  adds the Hot and Spicy Forums community patch v2037.

  - Expects the cdrom version of the game
  - Expects a zip archive of [Starfleet_2037](https://hotandspicyforums.com/sfc2-empires-at-war-patch-2-037-t20068.html)
  - Please report issues to the lutris_installer repo: 
  https://github.com/jrobio/lutris_installers

  ## Wine Install Notes
  - Forfeit the Taldren upsell messages. They will provide an option to turn 
  them off after 3 attempts.
  - Do not install directx 7.
  - Installer will prompt user for desired resolution from supported options, 
  including:
      - '640x480'
      - '800x600'
      - '1280x720'
      - '1360x768'
      - '1366x768'
      - '1600x900'
      - '1920x1080'
  - The installer Requires `perl`, but most linux distributions should have this 
  as a default package.
  - Exit the notepads spawned by the patch installation process to continue
  installation.
  - Installation of the patches may hang for a few seconds after completion, 
  this is expected.
  - Close the installer, rather than launch the game, on completion.

  ## Known Issues

  - The tutorials do not work...sorry.
