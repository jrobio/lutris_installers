# Lutris Installer Scripts

A repository containing all the lutris scripts I maintain. If you have suggestions for improvement or are experiencing issues with them, please let me know.

## Goals

- Make available as many Star Trek games as practical for the linux operating system.
- Bundle mods/unofficial patches that modernize the experience.
- Target Valve's Steam Deck hardware.
