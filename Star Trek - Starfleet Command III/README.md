## Wine Install Notes

- Default install location and parameters offered through the GOG Installer are 
recommended
- After GOG's installer completes `EXIT` the launcher.
- Default install location and parameters offered through the SFC Upgrade 3.3 
All in One Installer are recommended
- Launch `dxcfg.exe` within your prefix and make changes specific to your 
system.

## Known Issues

- SFC 3 has issues closing after launching a mission. Right now I'm just killing
 the process after I'm done, which isn't ideal, but it works.
