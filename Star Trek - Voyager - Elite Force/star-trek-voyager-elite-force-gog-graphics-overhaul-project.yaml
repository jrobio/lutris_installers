    ## Wine Install Notes

    - This installer expects a installed version of **Star Trek: Voyager - Elite Force** registered in Lutris.

    ## Versions

    ### Graphics Overhaul Project Mod

    - Expects a rar archive of [don_quichote's](https://www.moddb.com/members/don-quichote) mod: [Graphic Overhaul Project](https://www.moddb.com/mods/elite-force-graphic-overhaul-project).
    - Expects the Expansion to be installed (the [GOG](https://www.gog.com/en/game/star_trek_voyager_elite_force) version of the game has this included in its installer).
    - **Star Trek: Voyager - Elite Force** should be launched at least once before using this installer.
    - The installer alters `autoexec.cfg` to the desktop resolution and sets English as the default language.

    #### Known Issues

    - Known issues [ModDB Forum post](https://www.moddb.com/mods/elite-force-graphic-overhaul-project/forum/thread/known-bugs-and-issues-v090)
    - `Quake3.exe` has been set as the main file. However, if you experience [performance issues](https://www.moddb.com/mods/elite-force-graphic-overhaul-project/forum/thread/mod-installation-v090-and-configuration), you may wish to change that to `stvoy_GOP_SP.exe`.
    - Installation of this mod is not recommended on systems with displays smaller than 1920x1080 (ex. Valve's Steam Deck). That said, it works well in the Steam Deck's desktop mode, should you have a docked monitor resolution of 1920x1080 or greater.
