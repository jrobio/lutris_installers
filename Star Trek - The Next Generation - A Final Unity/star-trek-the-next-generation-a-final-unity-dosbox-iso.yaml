description: "Star Trek: The Next Generation - A Final Unity. Abandonware for 
DOSBox."
notes: |
  This script installs Star Trek: The Next Generation - A Final Unity through 
  DOSBox.

  - The installer expects either a zipped archive containing an NRG or an ISO 
  of the game.
  - Please report issues to the lutris_installer repo: 
  https://github.com/jrobio/lutris_installers

  ## DOSBox Install Notes

  - Install the optimal version of the game. 
  - Installation appears to hang at different percentages but it will complete. 
  You can elect to increase cycles here to speed up the process as long as they 
  are returned to 3000 at the end.
  - Configure hardware
      - Setup the sound card through autodetection
      - Setup video mode: Select the highest resolution and turn fullscreen on.
  - Exit and save the configuration.

  ## Versions

  ### ISO

  - This installer expects an ISO named `Star Trek The Next Generation - A Final
   Unity.iso`
  - Select this install script if your system cannot easily add binaries from a 
  traditional package manager (ex. Valve's Steam Deck) and instead would rely on
   a flatpak of PowerISO to achieve a conversion from NRG to ISO.

  ## Known Issues

  - If DOSBox is failing to launch from script execution, execute 
  `~/.local/share/lutris/runners/dosbox/dosbox` to identify missing libraries 
  for system installation.
