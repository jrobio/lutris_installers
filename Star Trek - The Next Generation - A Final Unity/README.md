## DOSBox Install Notes

- Install the optimal version of the game. 
- Installation appears to hang at different percentages but it will complete. You can elect to increase cycles here to speed up the process as long as they are returned to 3000 at the end.
- Configure hardware
    - Setup the sound card through autodetection
    - Setup video mode: Select the highest resolution and turn fullscreen on.
- Exit and save the configuration.

## Versions

### NRG

- This installer expects a zipped archive containing an file named Star Trek The Next Generation - A Final Unity.nrg
- Select this install script if your system has nrg2iso installed, or you would like to install it.

### ISO

- This installer expects an ISO named Star Trek The Next Generation - A Final Unity.iso
- Select this install script if your system cannot easily add binaries from a traditional package manager (ex. Valve's Steam Deck) and instead would rely on a flatpak of PowerISO to achieve a conversion from NRG to ISO.
